# TTRPG Map Sketcher

## Getting started

* Run `npm install`.
* Start the server with `npm start`.
* Run `npm run build` to build the client.

If you want to persist updates, pass an extra argument to `npm start`, for instance:

```
npm start -- example.log
```

During development:

* Run `npm run watch` to continuously build the client.
* Run `npm run check-watch` to continuously type-check the client.
* Run `npm run eslint` to run eslint.
